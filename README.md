StarryNight
===========

StarryNight is an environment shader (based off horizon.c) that generates and
renders a random star field.

The plug-in lacks AA and might have been more useful if it had been written as
a pixel filter, but as an exercise in implementing a fairly speedy star field
data structure it was fairly successful.
